        <p>
          Sound of Text was originally created to help
          <a href="http://twitter.com/NickOnTheWeb" target="_blank">myself</a>
          learn Spanish. I wanted a website that could generate sound files
          so that I could download and attach them to
          <a href="http://apps.ankiweb.net">Anki</a> flash cards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, it is seeing quite a few users every day and I think it is the
          best (free) website for downloading MP3 audio files from text.
          Currently, only audio from Google Translate is available, but there is
          potential for more voice providers in the future.

        <p>There are many ways to contribute to making Sound of Text better.</p>
        <h3>Donate</h3>
        <p>
          Hosting Sound of Text is not very expensive, but I do and have spent
          a lot of time building, maintaining, and adding new features.
          Donating helps pay for the time I have already put into Sound of Text
          and will help pay for new features I really want to add.

        <h4>Donation Goals</h4>
        <p>
          I have also set up some donation goals to make donations and their
          outcomes more transparent.

              This is roughly the cost of hosting the website every month. If
